## MIX

[Hookstate](https://hookstate.js.org/docs/getting-started) is an amazing library to manage global state. One of its best features is how it manages [nested states](https://hookstate.js.org/docs/nested-state). I used this feature to build an extension of it that merely collects similar type data and organizes it using the class [Collections](https://github.com/saisumith770/-mix/blob/master/src/collections.ts). We normalize the data so that the library is performant.

### AIM

-   Collect data and manage it.
-   Segregate data in the form of groups.
-   Have selectors to select certain data.

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/saisumith770/-mix.git
```

I'm currently working on pushing the npm package out as soon as possible.

### Examples

**React example coming soon**
